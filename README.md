## 🌟 Overview

This repository provides a curated collection of notes, resources, practice materials, and structured files designed to guide absolute beginners through the essential elements of the Japanese language. The goal is to establish a strong foundation in reading, writing, and basic conversational skills.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use the resources, you can clone the repository to your local machine or download the files directly.

### Cloning the Repository

1.  **Open your terminal** or command prompt.
2.  **Navigate** to the directory where you want to save the files.
3.  **Run the following command:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/naeron75/basic-japanese-learning.git](https://github.com/naeron75/basic-japanese-learning.git)
    cd basic-japanese-learning
    ```

### Using the `requirements.txt`

If this repository includes any Python scripts (e.g., for data processing, flashcard generation, or automated tasks), you will need to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

1.  **Ensure Python and pip are installed** on your system.
2.  **Navigate** to the root directory of the cloned repository (if you are not already there).
3.  **Run the installation command** using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *Note: It's often a good practice to use a **virtual environment** (like `venv` or `conda`) to manage project-specific dependencies.*

### Using your own .env file

If you want to connect to a MySQL Databse or BigQuery for example, you need to have your own .env file stored in the repository.
